## Integration with Other Agents

### Researcher Agent
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8083`
- **Purpose:** Gather facts, statistics, and background information
- **Skill Used:** `research.questions.bulk_research`
- **Execution:** Parallel with Archivist

### Archivist Agent (External)
- **URL:** Configured via `ELASTIC_ARCHIVIST_AGENT_CARD_URL`
- **Purpose:** Search historical articles for context
- **Skill Used:** `platform.core.search`
- **Execution:** Parallel with Researcher
- **Optional:** System works without it

### Editor Agent
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8082`
- **Purpose:** Review draft for quality and consistency
- **Skill Used:** `editorial.review.draft_review`

### Publisher Agent
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8084`
- **Purpose:** Publish finalized article to Elasticsearch
- **Skill Used:** `publishing.article.publish`

## Parallel Research Execution

The Reporter calls both Researcher and Archivist **in parallel** for efficiency:

```python
# Execute both in parallel
research_response, archive_response = await asyncio.gather(
    researcher_task,
    archivist_task,
    return_exceptions=True
)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Speed:** Total time = max(researcher_time, archivist_time)
- **Resilience:** If one fails, the other's results are still used
- **Efficiency:** No sequential blocking

## Article Generation

### Research Questions

The Reporter generates 5 research questions based on the topic:
1. **Statistics:** Key data points and percentages
2. **Companies:** Major players and stakeholders
3. **Context:** Background and historical perspective
4. **Impact:** Effects on industry and society
5. **Future:** Trends and predictions

### Content Integration

Article generation combines:
- **Topic & Angle:** From assignment
- **Research Data:** Facts, figures, and sources from Researcher
- **Historical Context:** Past coverage from Archivist
- **AI Generation:** Claude Sonnet 4 creates cohesive narrative

### Style Guidelines

Generated articles follow professional journalism standards:
- Clear, engaging introduction (lede paragraph)
- Well-structured body paragraphs
- Natural integration of statistics and data
- Balanced and objective tone
- Fresh perspective (avoiding repetition of historical coverage)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: Anthropic API for article generation
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxx...

# Optional: Archivist A2A agent for historical context
ELASTIC_ARCHIVIST_AGENT_CARD_URL=https://.../.well-known/a2a/agent-card.json
ELASTIC_ARCHIVIST_API_KEY=your_archivist_api_key_here

# Default agent URLs (optional)
EDITOR_URL=http://localhost:8082
RESEARCHER_URL=http://localhost:8083
PUBLISHER_URL=http://localhost:8084
```

### Port Configuration

```bash
uvicorn agents.reporter:app --host localhost --port 8081
```

## Running the Agent

### Start via Script
```bash
./start_newsroom.sh
```

### Start Individually
```bash
uvicorn agents.reporter:app --host localhost --port 8081
```

### Start with Hot Reload (Development)
```bash
uvicorn agents.reporter:app --host localhost --port 8081 --reload
```

## Agent Card

Access the agent card at:
```
http://localhost:8081/.well-known/agent-card.json
```

## Logging

Logs are written to `newsroom.log` with the `[REPORTER]` prefix.

Example log output:
```
2025-01-07 12:00:00 [REPORTER] INFO: üì• Received query: {"action": "accept_assignment", ...
2025-01-07 12:00:05 [REPORTER] INFO: üìö Generating 5 research questions...

2025-01-07 12:00:20 [REPORTER] INFO: ‚úçÔ∏è  Generating article with Claude Sonnet 4...
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Anthropic API Key
If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set:
- Warning logged: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set - will use mock article generation`
- Mock article generated as fallback

### Archivist Unavailable
If Archivist is not configured or fails:
- Warning logged: `ELASTIC_ARCHIVIST_AGENT_CARD_URL not set - skipping archive search`
- Article generation continues with just research data
- System remains fully functional

### Researcher Failure
If Researcher fails:
- Error logged but article generation continues
- Uses `return_exceptions=True` in parallel execution

## Testing

The Reporter is tested as part of the end-to-end workflow:

```bash
python tests/test_newsroom_workflow.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ REPORTER: Assignment accepted
‚úÖ REPORTER: Article written and submitted to Editor
   Headline: AI Agents Transform Modern Newsrooms
   Word Count: 985
```

## Best Practices

1. **Research Questions:** Let the Reporter auto-generate questions for comprehensive coverage
2. **Target Length:** Provide realistic word counts (800-1500 words typical)
3. **Priority Handling:** High priority stories get more detailed research
4. **Archive Context:** Configure Archivist for richer historical perspective

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Source Research:** Integrate additional research APIs
2. **Style Templates:** Support different article formats (news, feature, opinion)
3. **Draft Versioning:** Track revision history
4. **Collaborative Writing:** Multiple reporters on single article
